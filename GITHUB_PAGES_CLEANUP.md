# GitHub Pages Cleanup Guide

## âœ… Completed Automatically:

- [x] Removed GitHub Pages deployment workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- [x] Removed `gh-pages` package dependency
- [x] Removed `predeploy` and `deploy` scripts from package.json
- [x] Updated canonical URL to theodorosmentis.com
- [x] Updated portfolio URL in project data

## ðŸ”§ Manual Steps Required:

### 1. Disable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings:

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/jepeteo/portfolio
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" section in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Set branch to "None" to disable GitHub Pages
6. Save the changes

### 2. Clean up any remaining gh-pages branch (if exists):

```bash
# Check if gh-pages branch exists
git branch -a | grep gh-pages

# If it exists, delete it locally and remotely
git branch -D gh-pages          # Delete local branch
git push origin --delete gh-pages   # Delete remote branch
```

### 3. Optional - Remove old GitHub Pages deployment history:

The old deployments will remain in the repository's Actions history, but they won't affect anything. You can leave them for reference or manually delete them from the Actions tab.

## ðŸŽ¯ Result:

- âœ… No more GitHub Pages deployments
- âœ… All references point to theodorosmentis.com
- âœ… Clean repository without gh-pages dependencies
- âœ… Vercel deployment is now the only deployment method

Your portfolio is now 100% on Vercel with no GitHub Pages remnants! ðŸŽ‰
