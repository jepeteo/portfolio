# Experience Section Updates

This document outlines the changes made to optimize the Experience section of the portfolio.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Removed Generated/Irrelevant Content

- **Achievements**: Removed achievement sections from job experience details as they contained generated content that wasn't always accurate
- **Experience Metrics**: Removed metrics display (projects, clients, etc.) from job details to keep content focused and relevant
- **Most Technologies Used Section**: Removed the TopTechnologies component to eliminate unnecessary content

### 2. Updated Experience Stats

- **Current Roles Stat**: Replaced with "Technical Skills" stat, showing the number of technologies mastered
- **Experience Years Rounding**: Updated to round up years of experience to the nearest whole year
  - Total experience years now use `Math.ceil()` for a more accurate representation
  - Freelance and employment years also rounded up to whole numbers
- **Advanced Tooltip Solution**: Created a portal-based tooltip component that renders outside parent containers
  - Fixed tooltip clipping and visibility issues by rendering directly to document.body
  - Added arrow pointer and improved visibility with better contrast (90% opacity)
  - Replaced scaling hover effect with a more subtle vertical translation
  - Implemented smooth animations and transitions with GPU acceleration
  - Made tooltips more concise and informative

### 3. Updated Experience Summary

- Modified the summary text to use rounded years values
- Removed "+" symbol after years in the total experience stat and added "Years" for clarity
- Improved stat display formatting for better readability

## Files Modified

- `src/hooks/useExperienceData.ts`: Updated calculation logic to round up years
- `src/components/experience/ExperienceStats.tsx`: Replaced "Current Roles" with "Technical Skills", updated icon, and implemented portal-based tooltips
- `src/components/experience/ExperienceDetails.tsx`: Removed achievements, technologies, and metrics sections
- `src/components/ModernExperience.tsx`: Removed TopTechnologies component and updated summary text
- `src/components/ui/Tooltip.tsx`: Created new reusable tooltip component with portal implementation

## Result

The Experience section is now more accurate, focused on relevant information, and eliminates generated/irrelevant content. By removing metrics, achievements, and technologies from individual job details, the component now focuses only on essential information: job title, company, period, location, description, and key responsibilities. The new portal-based tooltips provide context where needed without being affected by parent container overflow settings, ensuring they're always fully visible and accessible.
